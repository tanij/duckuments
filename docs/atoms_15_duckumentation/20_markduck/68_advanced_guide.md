# Embedding videos {#markduck-vimeo status=ready}

It is possible to embed Vimeo videos in the documentation.

Note: Do not upload the videos to your personal Vimeo account; they must all be
posted to the Duckietown Engineering account.

This is the syntax:

    <dtvideo src="vimeo:![vimeo ID]"/>

<div class="example-usage" markdown="1">

For example, this code:

    <div figure-id="fig:example-embed">
        <figcaption>Cool Duckietown by night</figcaption>
        <dtvideo src="vimeo:152825632"/>
    </div>

produces this result:

 <div figure-id="fig:example-embed">
    <figcaption>Cool Duckietown by night</figcaption>
    <dtvideo src="vimeo:152825632"/>
 </div>

</div>


Depending on the output media, the result will change:

* On the online book, the result is that a player is embedded.
* On the e-book version, the result is that a thumbnail is produced, with a link to the video;
* (future improvement) On the dead-tree version, a thumbnail is produced with a QR code linking to the video.


# `move-here` tag {#move-here status=deprecated}

Note: This feature is deprecated, as it causes more problems than it solves.

If a file contains the tag `move-here`, the fragment pointed by the `src` attribute is moved at the place of the tag.

This is used for autogenerated documentation.

Syntax:

    # Node `node`

    <move-here src='#package-node-autogenerated'/>
