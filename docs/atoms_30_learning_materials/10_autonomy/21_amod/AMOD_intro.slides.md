## Visions for autonomous vehicles

- **Vision 1** - **Use autonomous vehicles for Dangerous, Dull, Dirty jobs** ▶

  - Pushed by military interest (e.g. DARPA Grand Challenge)

- **Vision 2** - **Your next car can drive by itself** ▶

  - Natural evolution of driver assistance system.

- **Vision 3** - **Autonomous Mobility on Demand** ▶

  - Mobility is a service. Nobody owns a car. (Do you own any train?)
  - The cars have no steering wheel.
  - We don’t need parking spaces.
  - Level 4 is sufficient.
  
- Variation: freight instead of people.

## The race for AMOD

- [Waymo](https://waymo.com/) (Google) **[AMOD]**

- [Tesla Autopilot project](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/autopilot?redirect=no)

- [Uber Advanced Technologies](https://www.uber.com/info/atg/) **[AMOD]**

- [Cruise Automation](https://getcruise.com/) **[AMOD]**

- [nuTonomy](http://nutonomy.com/) **[AMOD]**

- [Zoox](http://zoox.com/) **[AMOD]**

- All automakers have AV divisions:

- - [Toyota Research Institute](http://www.tri.global/)
  - BMW **[AMOD]**
  - [Audi](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/06/audi-is-the-first-to-test-autonomous-vehicles-in-new-york/)
  - [Nissan](https://www.nissanusa.com/blog/autonomous-drive-car)
  - [Baidu](http://usa.baidu.com/adu/)

- (?) Apple "Project Titan"


## The economics of AMOD: cost structure

## Why AMOD is an easier target, technically

- **Comparing the two visions:**

  - Vision 2 - Your next car can drive by itself. ▶
  - Vision 3 - Autonomous Mobility on Demand. ▶

- **Technical advantages of AMOD:**

  - I choose **where** and **when** to deliver the service. ▶
  - I can have remote **supervisors** (1 supervisor: 50 cars). ▶
  - I don’t have to worry about (mis)users of the system. ▶
  - Every night, my cars come back to the garage (think, e.g., **calibration**). ▶
  - My cars are always updated (Each car lasts ~200,000 miles = 2 years) ▶

## Social benefits of AMOD

- Reduced accident fatalities

- More livable cities

   - No need for parking spaces
   - Fewer cars to provide the same service.


- City-level fleet management allows
   more efficient uses of resources.

   - You can plan service with demand.
   - City-level fleet coordination reduces traffic.
   - You can integrate with rail.

## Benefits of fleet management
