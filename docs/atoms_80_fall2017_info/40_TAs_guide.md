## First steps

Here are the first steps for the TAs.

Note that many of these are not sequential and can be done in parallel.

### Learn about Duckietown

Read about Duckietown's history; watch the Duckumentary.

See: [](+the_duckietown_project#duckietown-project)

### Online accounts

You have to set up:

- A personal  Github account
- A Twist account
- A Slack account
- A Google Docs account (Gmail address)

Send an email to Kirsten Bowser (akbowser@gmail.com), with your GMail address and your Github account.  She will give you further instructions.

Point of Contact: [Kirsten Bowser](mailto:akbowser@gmail.com)

### Install Ubuntu

Install Ubuntu 16.04 on your laptop,
and then install ROS, Atom, Liclipse, etc.

See: [](+opmanual_duckiebot#setup-laptop)

### Duckuments

Install the Duckuments system, so you can edit these instructions.

See: [](+duckumentation#contribute).

Point of Contact: Andrea

### Learn about Git and Github

Start learning about Git and Github. You don't have to read the entirety of the
following references now, but keep them "on your desk" for later reference.

See: [Good book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

See: [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

### Continuous integration

Understand the continuous integration system.

See: [Documentation on continuous integration](+software_devel#continuous-integration).

Point of Contact: Andrea

### Duckiebot building

Build your Duckiebot according to the instructions.

See: [](+opmanual_duckiebot#building-duckiebot-c0)

As you read the instructions, keep open the Duckuments source, and note any
discrepancies. You must note any unexpected thing that is not predicted from the
instruction. If you don't understand anything, please note it.

The idea is that dozens of other people will have to do the same after you, so
improving the documentation is the best use of your time, and it is much more
efficient than answering the same question dozens of times.

### Other documentation outside of the Duckuments

We have the following four documents outside of the duckuments:

1. [Organization chart][org-chart]: This is where we assign areas of responsibility.
2. [Lecture schedule][lecture-schedule]
3. [Checkoff spreadsheet][checkoff]
4. [The big TODO list][todo-list]: Where we keep track of things to do.
