    Please hold on for Github instructions.
</div>

Note that you should do a pull in `Software` to get all the goodies and utils described in the exercise,  and `exercises-fall2017` repos (in `exercises-fall2017` repo this means pulling from the **`duckietown`** remote:

    $ git pull upstream master

if you have followed the instructions properly.

In the `exercises-fall2017` repository, you will find a template that you can use to make your own package. Basically everywhere you see `littleredcorvette` you would need to replace it with your `![robot_name]`.
