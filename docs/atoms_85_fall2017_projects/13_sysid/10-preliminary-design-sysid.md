## Part 2: Definition of the problem

### Problem statement

Every Duckiebot is different in configuration.


> Mission = we need to make control robust to different configuration


> Problem statement = we need to identify kinematic model to make control robust enough



### Assumptions

* Robot will move only in horizontal plane
* No lateral slipping of robot
* The body fixed longitudinal velocity and angular velocity will be provided as well as the timestamp of each measurement


### Approach

* Simplified kinematic model will be used to estimate parameters for each duckiebot :
    - Semi axis length l
    - Mapping : voltage → velocity


#### Kinematic model



We make use of the no lateral slipping motion hypothesis and the pure rolling constrain as shown in the [#duckiebot-modeling](+learning_materials#duckiebot-modeling), to write the following equation:


\begin{align} \label{eq:mod-kin-3}
\left\{  \begin{array}{l} \dot x_A^R &= R (\dot \varphi_R +\dot \varphi_L)/2  \\
                          \dot y_A^R &= 0 \\
                          \dot \theta &= \omega = R(\dot \varphi_R - \dot \varphi_L)/(2L) \end{array} \right.,
\end{align}


Further we make the assumption that for steady state that there is a linear relationship between the input voltage and the velociy of the wheel:

\begin{align} \label{eq:mod-kin-4}
v_r=R \dot \varphi_l=c_r V_r\\
v_r=R \dot \varphi_l=c_l V_l
\end{align}

This lets us rewrite equation \eqref{eq:mod-kin-3}:

\begin{align} \label{eq:mod-kin-5}
\left\{  \begin{array}{l} \dot x_A^R &= (c_r V_r+c_l V_l)/2  \\
                          \dot y_A^R &= 0 \\
                          \dot \theta &= \omega = (c_r V_r+c_l V_l)/(2L) \end{array} \right.,
\end{align}

Using the assumption that we can measure $v_A$  we can determine $c_r$ by setting the voltage $V_l=0$.
The same procedure can be done to get $c_l$.

Using the assumption that we can measure $\dot \theta$ we will then get the semiaxis length $L$.

### Functionality-resources trade-offs


### Functionality provided

* A model with calibrated parameters for each duckiebot
* A calibration protocol that creates a map of:
    * input voltage → output longitudinal and angular velocity
* Semi axis length


### Resources required / dependencies / costs

* Good state estimation, independent of a model
* potential approaches for state estimate
    - lane filter
    - april tags
    - camera calibration sheet
* Accurate line-detection
* Accurate april tags



### Performance measurement

Run lane follower with old version and new version with kinematic model. Drive on the track for one minute and count the number of times the bot touches the side or center line.

**Metrics**

- Robustness to different duckies
    - Control can handle different duckiebot configurations based on our models-
- Robustness to different wheels
    - Omnidirectional wheel, caster wheel
- Robustness to initial pose
    - Run lane following using 5 different initial poses
- Repeatability
    - Run lane following 5 times and compare

We will use the performance measurement setup of the devel-control group

[Handbook of robotics](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0lwdwyt1a61jh0k/handbook%20of%20robotics.pdf?dl=0)

the above contains a number of interesting sections of relevance to the work of this group:

- exact modeling of caster wheel and the kinematic constraints it introduces (pg. 395)

- different system identification procedures: parametric or nonparametric (Chapter 14); in particular, a note on Observability (pg. 337)

- we want to maximize performance of control + localization. Control uses unicycle model in Frenet frame (pg. 803 of handbook of robotics)

- We need to identify wheel radii (r_1, r_2: assume equal at start = r), semi-axle length L, and motors steady state parameters (mapping between voltage and angular rate, i.e. mapping between voltage and velocity once (a) wheel radius is known and no slipping hypothesis is made).

- Adaptive control (pg. 147): another approach is implementing an adaptive controller. It is  meant to work with plant uncertainty.

### Risk analysis

What could go wrong?

- It could happen that we identify a model which is not useful for control.
- Perfect model will be useless if control is not improved

Mitigation strategy:

- Early testing with control group
