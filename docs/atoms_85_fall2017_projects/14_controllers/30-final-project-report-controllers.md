## Mission and Scope {#controllers-final-scope}

Motto: IMPERIUM ET POTESTAS EST <br/> (With control comes power)

Our **Mission** was to make lane following more robust to model assumptions and Duckietown geometric specification violations and provide control for a different reference.


### Motivation {#controllers-final-result-motivation}

In Duckietown, Duckiebots are cruising on the streets and also Duckies are sitting on the sidewalk waiting for a Duckiebot to pick them up. To ensure a baseline safety of the Duckiebots and the Duckies, we have to make sure the Duckiebots are able to follow the lane (or a path on intersections and in parking lots) and stop in front of red lines. For instance, the Duckiebot is driving on the right lane. It should never cross the centerline to avoid any collisions with an oncoming Duckiebot.

The overall goal of our project is to stay in the lane while driving and stopping in front of a red line. Due to the tight time plan, we focused on improving the existing code and benchmarking the tasks. In order to let the Duckiebot drive to a given point, the robot has to know where it is in the lane, calculate the error and define a control action to reach the target. To retrieve the location and orientation information, a pose estimator is implemented. The estimator receives line segments from the image pipeline with information about line tape colour (white, yellow, red) ([](#fig:segment_foto)) and whether the segment is on the left or right edge of the line tape. Using those information, we determine if the Duckiebot is inside or outside the lane, how far it is from the middle of the lane and at what angle it stands. The relative location to the middle of the lane and the orientation of the Duckiebot are passed on to the controller. In order to minimize the error, the controller calculates the desired velocity and heading of the Duckiebot using the inputs and controller parameters. The importance of our project in the framework “Duckietown” was obvious, as it contains the fundamental functionality of autonomous driving. Furthermore, many other projects relied on our project’s functionality such as obstacle avoidance, intersection navigation or parking of a Duckiebot. We had to ensure that our part is robust and reliable.

<center><img figure-id="fig:curve_plot2" figure-caption="Pose of Duckiebot in a curve element." src="curve_plot.png" alt="Curve plot" style="width: 200px;"/></center>

From last year’s project, the baseline implementation of a pose estimator and a controller were provided to us for further improvement. The prior pose estimator was designed to deliver the pose for a Duckiebot on straight lanes only. If the Duckiebot was in or before a curve and in the middle of the lane, the estimated pose showed an offset **d**, see definition of **d** in figure below. The existing controller worked reasonably on straight lines. Although, due to the inputs from the pose estimator to the controller, the Duckiebot overshot in the curves and crossed the left/right line during or after the curve.

</div>

### Opportunity {#controllers-final-opportunity}

<!--
- What didn't work out with the existing solution? Why did it need improvement?
-->

In the **previous** implementation, the lane following was not guaranteed on curved lane segments, because the Duckiebot often left the lane while driving in the curve or after the curve. Although the Duckiebot sometimes returned correctly to the right lane after leaving it and continued following the lane, robust lane following was not provided. On straight lanes, the Duckiebot frequently drove with a large static offset from the center of the lane. The previously implemented pose estimator and controller left room for improvement.

Further, the previous lane controller was not benchmarked for robustness nor for performance, therefore we defined various tests to benchmark the previous controller and our updated solution. During the project, we continuously tested our code with the entire lane following pipeline for best practice and compared our implemented solution to the existing one to record the improvement.

Our **Scope** was first of all to enable controlled autonomous driving of the Duckiebot on straight lane segments and curved lane segments which are in compliance with the geometry defined in [Duckietown Appearance Specifications](+opmanual_duckietown#duckietown-specs). Further, we wanted to enhance the robustness to arbitrary geometry of lane width or curvature of the lane to ensure the autonomous driving of the Duckiebot in an individual Duckietown setup.
We also tackled the detection and stopping at red (stop) lines. With the previous implementation, the Duckiebot stopped rather at random points in front of the red line. We wanted to improve the implementation, to ensure a stop in the middle of the lane, in a predefined range and at a straight angle to the red line.
As the Duckietown framework is a complex system involving various functionalities such as obstacle avoidance and intersection navigation, our lane following pipeline provides the basic function for those functionalities and it has to be able to interact with the modules of other teams. Hence, it was also our duty to design an interface which can receive and apply information from other modules.  For example, our controller can take reference **d** from obstacle avoidance, intersection crossing and parking. For intersection navigation and parking, our controller needs additionally the pose estimation and a curvature from the navigators and the parking team respectively.

Out of scope was:

* Pose estimation and curvature on Intersections (plus navigation / coordination)
* Model of Duckiebot and uncertainty quantification of parameters (System Identification)
* Object avoidance involving going to the left lane
* Extraction and classification of edges from images (anti-instagram)
* Any hardware design
* Controller for Custom maneuvers (e.g. Parking, Special intersection control)
* Robustness to non existing line

<!--
_Up to now it was all fun and giggles. This is the most important part of your report: a crisp mathematical definition of the problem you tackled. You can use part of the preliminary design document to fill this section._
-->

Our final objective is to keep the Duckiebots at a given distance **d** from the center of the lane, on straight and curved roads, under bounded variations of the city geometric specifications.

The project was on the bottom line, taking the line segments which gave information about the line colour and the segment positions to estimate the Duckiebot’s pose and return a command for the motors to steer the robot to the center of the lane. After roughly analysing the existing solution, we divided the work load into two topics **pose estimation** and **controller** to enable parallel dealing with the problems in the short period of time.

In our [Preliminary Design Document](#controllers-pdd) and [Intermediate Report](#controllers-int-report), we have listed all variables and their definitions, as well as all system interfaces with other groups and assumptions we made. Due to limitation of time and different priorities of other teams, some integrations with other teams are not yet activated but they are already prepared in our code (some of it commented out).


### Pose Estimation

Starting with the image taken by a monocular camera, we assume that [Anti-Instagram](#anti-instagram-final-report) compensates for color changes from different ambient light conditions and the detected segments of the line edges are always in the corresponding colour (yellow, white, red) to the tape and point to the correct direction (to the Duckiebot = left edge, away from the Duckiebot = right edge), see ([](#fig:segment_foto)). The detected line segments are passed on in a list to the ‘Lane Filter‘, the Duckiebot estimates the distance $d_{est}$ from center of the lane and heading $\theta_{est}$ with respect to the center of the lane.  

To improve curve following, our main goal was to decrease the overshoot after a turn. A main reason for the overshoot was that the previous implementation of the pose estimator was designed for straight lanes only. We planned to predict if a curve is upcoming and in which direction the turn will be. This curvature estimation could then be used as an input for a feedforward part of the controller. This would help for a smoother transition in curves.

We planned on testing two different ideas for curvature estimation. One based on the distribution of segments to different domains with different ranges. The second one based on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).

Our general goal was to improve the accuracy of estimated pose in regard to reference pose and increase the computational efficiency. Also robustness regarding slight changes in width of the lane, width of the lines and curvature should be achieved.

#### How the pose estimation works

<center><img figure-id="fig:vote_generation_straight" figure-caption="Vote generation on straight lane from one line segment." src="vote_generation_straight.svg" alt="Vote generation on straight lane." style="width: 300px;"/></center>




The lane filter gets a list of detected segments by the line filter with their colors. One segment is described by two vectors pointing from the center of the Duckiebot to the start and endpoint of the segment as shown in [](#fig:vote_generation_straight) where one segment is described by the vectors $p_1$ and $p_2$. From these two points we can calculate the vector $t$ which is tangential to the segment and the vector $n$ which is perpendicular to the segment. The vector $t$ can be calculated using

\begin{equation}
    t = \frac{p_2-p_1}{||p_2 - p_1 ||}
\end{equation}

and $n$ is the unit vector perpendicular to $t$. In case the segment was perfectly detected, the distance of the center of the Duckiebot to the white line is then the scalar product of $p_1$ with $n$. By using the width of the lane we can calculate the distance from the center of the lane.

To get the angle $\phi$ we use the fact that the tangential vector $t$ is scaled to length one. From the geometry in [](#vote_generation_straight_phi) we see that $\phi$ can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
    \phi = \arcsin \left(t_2 \right)
\end{equation}


<center><img figure-id="fig:vote_generation_straight_phi" figure-caption="Geometry for getting the angle $\phi$." src="vote_generation_straight_phi.png" alt="Vote generation on straight lane." style="width: 200px;"/></center>




This gives one vote consisting of the two coordinates shown in [](#fig:vote_generation_straight) where $\theta$ and $\phi$ are representing the same coordinate. For every detected segment one of those votes can be calculated. The one pose having the most votes will be selected as our estimated pose.

#### Vote generation on a curve

<center><img figure-id="fig:vote_generation_curve" figure-caption="Vote generation on curved lane from one line segment." src="vote_generation_curve.svg" alt="Vote generation on curved lane." style="width: 300px;"/></center>





On a curved lane the generation of votes differs from the one on a straight lane. We derived the vote generation on a curved lane, but did not implement it since a working curvature estimation is needed for this. Again we generate a vote for one given segment with the two endpoints $p_1$ and $p_2$ and additionally we need to know the radius $r$ of this segment. The geometry is shown in [](#fig:vote_generation_curve). We again calculate the tangential vector $t$ and normal vector $n$ as shown before. We get the center point $p$ of the segment using

\begin{equation}
    p = \frac{p_1 + p_2}{2}
\end{equation}

Now we can get the two lengths $a$ and $b$ by taking the scalar product of $p$ with $n$ and $p$ with $t$ respectively. Using this we can find the length of $r_1$ by

\begin{equation}
    ||r_1|| = \sqrt{\left(||r|| - a \right)^2 + \left(b\right)^2}
\end{equation}

From this we can get the length of $d$ using

\begin{equation}
    d = ||r_1|| - \left(r - \frac{lanewidth}{2}\right)  
\end{equation}

In the end, $\phi$ can be obtained using $d$ and the $x$ coordinate vector of the Duckiebot coordinate system. This gives us the **pose** of the Duckiebot in a curve.


### Controller


In the existing implementation, the controller has taken the output of the estimator as input and calculated the motor command, velocity **v** and angular velocity **$\omega$**, with help of hardcoded parameters. Running the current lane following demo, we determined the weaknesses of the controller’s performance. Since the existing controller only had a proportional part (P-part) and the **$\theta$** acted similarly to a derivative part, (D-part), we decided to implement following parts and benchmark its performance.

* Integrator for both **$\theta$** and **d**
    - First approach: No saturation for integrator
        * Problem: Very strong oscillation
    - Second approach: Saturation for integrator
        * Performance improved a lot. Oscillation is reduced
    - Third approach: Saturation of integrator and reset of integrator whenever zero error is reached
        * Performance improved again.
    - Fourth approach: Added true integration with correct timestep instead of simply summing up the error and neglecting the timestep
        * This is the correct approach since the time step needs to be taken into account.
* Feedforward for driving on a curved lane
    - We take the current curvature as an Input for the feedforward part
        * The feedforward part is very much dependent on the correct curvature estimation. If curvature was estimated correctly, feedforward worked well.


In some cases, the controller won’t need the real time pose input of the pose estimator but a given path from other teams for example during intersection navigation. For this task, we had to define a more general ‘Lane Pose‘ message, communicate and coordinate the integration with other teams and subscribe to the topic of their nodes (see [Subscribed topics by Lane Controller Node](#controllers-int-report)). To decide about the input source, we have to subscribe to flags passed by the other teams and create a prioritization logic.

Regarding performance, the Duckiebot should have a small steady state error within a tile and never leave the lane given the [Duckietown appearance specifications](+opmanual_duckietown#duckietown-specs).

## Contribution / Added functionality {#controllers-final-contribution}

### Curvature Estimation
#### Curvature estimation using multiple domains

The idea of our curvature estimation approach is to split the domain in front of the Duckiebot into multiple range areas. A version using three areas is shown in [](#fig:curvature_estim).

<center><img figure-id="fig:curvature_estim" figure-caption="Curvature estimation using the segments in different domains." src="curvature_estim.svg" alt="Curvature estimation" style="width: 300px;"/></center>



In each of the range areas the road can roughly be assumed as a straight lane. But for every area further away from the bot this straight lane fit is tilted more towards the left. For each area, only those segments with center point inside the area are considered. Using these segments for each area, we run the standard estimation and thereafter for each area we get a **d** and a **$\theta$** value. Now we can compare those results with the **d** and **$\theta$** value from the estimation of the position.


The expected results are shown in [](#fig:curvature_estimation_expected) where the left most points in each graph represent the actual position estimation and the further three point represent the estimations of the three different range areas. As a leftover of the existing code where this was already the case, **$\phi$** and **$\theta$** are still used as synonyms within the code. Due to limited time, it did not make it to our highest priority at any time within our project, to merge those names. This should be done in future work.

<center><img figure-id="fig:curvature_estimation_expected" figure-caption="Expected results of d and $\phi$ values for straight lane, left curve and right curve." src="curvature_estimation_expected.jpg" alt="Expected results of curvature estimation" style="width: 300px;"/></center>


Unfortunately, the measurements for the higher ranges are very noisy as there are only a few line segments detected at further distance and therefore the signal to noise ratio is very bad. To get rid of outliers, we decided to add a median filter over values of the ranges. Additionally we saved this median **d** and **$\phi$** values over time for the last five time steps and again took the median value of it. Then we checked if it is above or below the value of the closest range.

Another possibility would be to fit a line through the data points and decide on the lane type based on the slope of the line. Nevertheless, we decided to use the before mentioned method using the median values because we wanted to keep the **computational complexity** as low as possible.

By testing we found good results for the cutoffs shown in [figure](#tab:curvature_cutoffs) where $d_{median}$ and $\phi_{median}$ represent the median over 5 time steps of the values resulting from the range area and $d_{est}$ and $\phi_{est}$ represent the actual pose estimate.

#### Curvature estimation using Discrete Fourier Transform

By generating a discrete binary image from the segments projected to the ground and applying the discrete fourier transform to this image, the curvature of the road in front of the Duckiebot can be detected. Fourier transforms of such binary images are shown in [](#fig:curvature_estimation_fourier). By using the correct fourier features, straight lanes, right and left curves could be detected due to to their differing fourier transform.

This method has been implemented successfully but the problem was first of all choosing the right resolution for the segment images and additionally, the method introduced a delay of about 0.2 seconds. Since we want to avoid decreasing the lane following performance of the Duckiebot, we decided to dismiss this method.

<center><img figure-id="fig:curvature_estimation_fourier" figure-caption="Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a street image in ground frame (credits jukindle)." src="curvature_estimation_dft.png" alt="Discrete Fourier Transform of street image" style="width: 300px;"/></center>




### Controller

In the controller, a feedforward part was added to figuratively speaking straighten the lane and ease the work of the controller. Therefore, the feedforward part takes the reference curvature **$c_{ref}$** and reference velocity **$v_{ref}$** as inputs and returns the needed yaw rate **$\omega$**, which is then added to the output of the controller. The block diagram of the control loop is shown in [](#fig:feedforward_diagram). Since the kinematic calibration was not yet yielding the demanded values of **$v_{ref}$** and **$\omega$** in **$[m/s]$** and **$[$rad$/s]$**, correction factors **velocity_to_m_per_s** and **omega_to_rad_per_s** were introduced. With the new kinematic calibration, those correction factors need to be adjusted or ideally become obsolete and need to be deleted in future work.

<center><img figure-id="fig:feedforward_diagram" figure-caption="Block diagram including feedforward part (FF)" src="feedforward_diagram.png" alt="Block diagram feedforward." style="width: 300px;"/></center>




The feedforward part also enables the controller to work for other applications than just lane following. It can follow a path, for example on intersections and parking lots, if the information (including localization) is given in the format described in our [Intermediate Report](#controllers-int-report). The respective code is written but some of it is commented out respectively not activated yet due to the limited time of the project and the coordination between teams.

From the coordinates as shown in [](#fig:vote_generation_straight), we get

\begin{equation}
    \left[ \begin{array}{c} \dot {d} \\ \dot \theta \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} v \times \sin \theta \\ \omega \end{array} \right]
\end{equation}

Through linearization, assuming **$\theta$** to stay small and with **$u = \omega$**, this becomes

\begin{equation}
    \left[ \begin{array}{c} \dot {d} \\ \dot \theta \end{array} \right] = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & v \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \times \left[ \begin{array}{c} d \\ \theta \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right] \times u
\end{equation}

with

\begin{equation}
    x = \left[ \begin{array}{c} d \\ \theta \end{array} \right]
\end{equation}

To reduce static offset, integral parts were implemented for both **$d$** and **$\theta$**. This was achieved by augmenting the system to **$\hat{x}$**, as shown below.

\begin{equation}
    \hat{x} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ e_I \end{array} \right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \left[ \begin{array}{c} \dot{x} \\ \dot{e_I} \end{array} \right] = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & v & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \times \left[ \begin{array}{c} x \\ e_I \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right] \times u + \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \times x_{ref}
\end{equation}

With

\begin{equation}
    \left[ \begin{array}{c} e \\ e_I \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} x_{ref} - x \\ \int {(x_{ref} - x)} dt  \end{array} \right]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    x_{ref} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} d_{ref} \\ \theta_{ref} \end{array} \right]
\end{equation}

In order to omit oscillation and guarantee the stability of the system, the poles were placed on the negative real axis. With that we found the initial values for **$k_p$** and **$k_I$** in

\begin{equation}
    u = - \left[ \begin{matrix} k_p & k_I \end{matrix}\right] \times \left[ \begin{array}{c} e \\ e_I \end{array} \right]
\end{equation}

through

\begin{equation}
    \left[ \begin{array}{c} \dot {d} \\ \dot \theta \end{array} \right] = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & v \\ -k_p & -k_I \end{pmatrix} \times \left[ \begin{array}{c} d \\ \theta \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \end{array} \right] \times x_{ref}
\end{equation}

The controllability matrix shows that the integrator of **$\theta$** is not controllable, since it has rank 3 instead of 4:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{C} = \left[ \begin{matrix} B & AB & A^2B & A^3B \end{matrix}\right] = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & v & 0 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -v & 0 \\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

To prevent the integral parts from diverging, an **Anti Reset Windup** was implemented. Therefore, whenever actuator limits were reached, the integral steps at the corresponding time step were not added to the integrator. The actuator limits were reached when the motors were sent lower values than would be necessary to reach the controller outputs, because of certain limitations within the software. The limitations include for example a limitation on the turn radius of the Duckiebot, because it should not be able to turn on the spot but to move more similarly to common passenger cars.

In curves, the integrator values accumulate rapidly and lead to an overshoot after the curve. A possible approach would be to turn off the integrator in curves, but in consequence the curvature estimation would need to be used and in addition need to be robust. Or if the feedforward part could be fully used (while also needing a robust and low-latency curvature estimation), the problem might be diminished. In the current state, the integrator is reset to zero whenever it is at or crosses the zone of zero error. In addition the integrator was also reset to zero, whenever the velocity sent to the motors was zero.

Since the integral part of theta is not controllable, it was set to zero. The resulting parameter, the proportional gains of both **$d$** and **$\theta$** plus the integrator gain of **$d$**, were tuned. First with pole placement initial values were approximated, as described above. For the final tuning, each parameter was varied until the unstable state and the approximate boundary to the stable state were found, while all the other parameters were kept in a stable state. <!-- For the final tuning  the unstable state and the approximate boundary thereof was looked for through each parameter with all the other parameters in a stable state. -->This was repeated multiple times with ever more aggressive controller behavior until an optimum was found. The controller is optimized to run with a gain (of the kinematic calibration) of 0.6.



### Benchmark

To benchmark the state zero at the beginning of the project and our final implementation and to compare them, we implemented a benchmark package. This package contains the benchmark code used for the Controllers project. It basically takes one or more rosbags in a specific folder and evaluates the run of the corresponding Duckiebot for **$d_{ref}$** and **$\phi_{ref}$** and plots them into a diagram.

Additionally if the rosbag does not contain any pose information, it takes the pictures and calculates the transformation and line segments itself. It also plots the values onto the pictures, so those pictures can be combined to a video.

#### Output

The output diagram should look like the one shown in [](#fig:ducktaped_ETHZ_2018-01-12-14-24-51).

An example of a processed frame is shown in [](#fig:segment_foto). To run the benchmark code see the __README__ file in duckietown/Software/catkin_ws/src/10-lane-control/benchmark.

<!--

#### How to run

You need to navigate to the folder that contains the benchmark code. In this case:

    $ /catkin_ws/src/10-lane-control/benchmark/

Then execute the following code:

    $ python benchmark path/to/folder_containing_rosbags

You can specify the path to a single rosbag or you can specify the general folder containing several rosbags and it will process all those which have not been processed yet and save the output into a folder __output__ unless otherwise defined.
To get help on the flags type:

    $ python benchmark --help

There are the following flags:

     --output     Name of the output folder (Default: 'output')
     --save_images     Extract and safe all frames from the rosbag (Default: False)
     --preparer    Define other preparer for image pipeline (Default: prep_120_40)
     --fast        Do not process image frames (Default: True)

### Logs

We took a huge amount of logs to benchmark the performance of the controller and estimator. These logs are available [here](http://logs.duckietown.org). Our Duckiebots were a313, yaf, fobot, ducktaped and tori.

We evaluated the improvement of the performance with help of several tests. The evaluation procedure are defined in our [Intermediate Report](#controllers-int-report). The main benchmark feature was the average deviation from tracking reference during a run (distance to middle lane) and the standard deviation of the same value. We also benchmarked the deviation from the heading angle as well but since the bot is mainly controlled according to the deviation of the tracking distance, it was the main feature to lead our development.
Benchmarking in general occurred by letting the Duckiebot run a specific experiment and recording a rosbag. We wrote a distinct offline benchmarking application mentioned above, that analyzes the rosbag containing the recorded values and creates plots with the extracted information about tracking distance and heading angle over the run.

Furthermore, we assessed the performance of the Duckiebots in the following dimensions:

* **Estimator**:
    - Static lane pose estimation benchmark
    - Static curve pose estimation benchmark
    - Image resolution benchmark
    - Segment interpolation benchmark
    - Curvature estimation benchmark
* **Controller**:
    - Stop at red line benchmark
    - Controller benchmark
    - Non-conforming curve benchmark
### Performance Evaluation of Estimator

#### Static lane pose estimation benchmark

In the static lane pose estimation, we put the Duckiebot on predefined poses and checked how well the pose estimator performs. In this section, the Duckiebot was placed on a straight lane segment with different measured distances from the middle of the lane and different measured heading angles. The results can be seen in the following graphs:

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_static_straight_d" figure-caption="Old Lane Estimator Performance of estimating $d$ on straight lane." src="perf_static_straight_d.png" alt="Old Lane Estimator Performance on straight lane" style="width: 400px;"/></center>




As one can see from [](#fig:perf_static_straight_d), the estimated distance from the middle of the lane and the actual value correspond very good in most experiments. There is only one case where the actual deviation was $-1 cm$ and measured was $4 cm$. Note that the histogram resolution used to determine the pose is $1 cm$.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_static_straight_phi" figure-caption="Old Lane Estimator Performance of estimating $\phi$ on straight lane." src="perf_static_straight_phi.png" alt="Old Lane Estimator Performance on straight lane" style="width: 400px;"/></center>


[](#fig:perf_static_straight_phi) shows a similar picture for the heading angle estimation from the segments. Deviation from actual values vary from $1$ to $12^{\circ}$, whereas the Duckiebot performed better when being rotated to the left. Note that the histogram resolution to determine the heading angle is $3^{\circ}$ or $0.15 rad$.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_static_straight_delta" figure-caption="Differences of $d_{actual}$ and $d_{measured}$ and $\phi_{actual}$ and $\phi_{measured}$ respectively." src="perf_static_straight_delta.png" alt="Old Lane Estimator Performance on straight lane" style="width: 400px;"/></center>


If we look at the overall deviations in all experiments shown in [](#fig:perf_static_straight_delta), we can see that the pose estimator performs fairly well, and it is possible to control on the deviation of the distance. The heading angle shows more error. The average deviation from the actual tracking distance in all experiments accounts to $1.6 cm$ and the average deviation from the actual heading angle in all experiments is $7.2^{\circ}$.

#### Static curve pose estimation benchmark

In the static curve pose estimation, we put the Duckiebot on predefined poses and checked how well the pose estimator performs. In this section the Duckiebot was placed on left curve with different distances from the middle of the lane and different heading angles. The results can be seen in the following graphs:

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_static_curve_d" figure-caption="Old Lane Estimator Performance of estimating $d$ on curved lane." src="perf_static_curve_d.png" alt="Old Lane Estimator Performance on curved lane" style="width: 400px;"/></center>



As one can see from [](#fig:perf_static_curve_d), the estimated distance from the middle lane and the actual value correspond partially to the actual values. Especially for the distance of $10 cm$ to the right of the middle of the lane in a left curve the estimator has problems to detect the correct deviation. This is due to the low number of segments and the fact that the pose estimator is actually only constructed to estimate the pose on a straight lane. Also, there is quite some noise which leads to wrong interpretation of the distance, even when the Duckiebot is perfectly situated in the middle of the lane. For some experiments there is no pose estimation due to too much noise in the segment list. Note that the histogram resolution used to determine the pose is $1 cm$.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_static_curve_phi" figure-caption="Old Lane Estimator Performance of estimating $\phi$ on a curved lane." src="perf_static_curve_phi.png" alt="Old Lane Estimator Performance on curved lane" style="width: 400px;"/></center>



Whereas the estimator is still able to estimate $d$ quite well on a left curve, for the heading angle most of the values are completely off as can be seen in [](#fig:perf_static_curve_phi). This means the heading angle prediction is not reliable on curved lanes. Note that the histogram resolution to determine the heading angle is $3^{\circ}$ or $0.15 rad$.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_static_curve_delta" figure-caption="Differences of $d_{actual}$ and $d_{measured}$ and $\phi_{actual}$ and $\phi_{measured}$ respectively on a curved lane." src="perf_static_curve_delta.png" alt="Old Lane Estimator Performance on curved lane" style="width: 400px;"/></center>


If we look at the overall deviations in all experiments shown in [](#fig:perf_static_curve_delta), we can see that the pose estimator performs ok in the determination of the distance from the middle of the lane in a curved section. The values from the heading angle are unlikely correct and therefore should not be used as control input. The average deviation from the actual tracking distance in all experiments accounts to $1.8 cm$ and the average deviation from the actual heading angle in all experiments is $21.6^{\circ}$.

#### Image resolution benchmark

Since the image resolution has an impact on the number of segments being visible to the Duckiebot and the image processing latency time, we benchmarked the impact on the entire lane following performance. We tested different image resolutions, top cut off amounts and changed the histogram size to evaluate how it influences the control performance.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_image_res_yaf" figure-caption="Measured $d_{mean}$ and $\phi_{mean}$ values for different image resolutions for Duckiebot 'yaf'." src="perf_image_res_yaf.png" alt="Image Resolution performance yaf" style="width: 400px;"/></center>



As one can see in [](#fig:perf_image_res_yaf), the performance of the Duckiebot measured as the mean deviation from the reference trajectory (which is usually $0 cm$) is getting worse the higher the resolution. There are outliers though, since the highest resolution being tested shows better performance than the resolution just one step smaller. The best performance is achieved with slightly higher resolution at 150x200 pixels. To validate these results, we tested it on another Duckiebot as well.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_image_res_a313" figure-caption="Measured $d_{mean}$ and $\phi_{mean}$ values for different image resolutions for Duckiebot 'a313'." src="perf_image_res_a313.png" alt="Image Resolution performance a313" style="width: 400px;"/></center>



We see that the results shown in [](#fig:perf_image_res_yaf) and [](#fig:perf_image_res_a313) are not congruent. We think that this has to do with the fact that each Duckiebot is slightly different and also has different latencies.

The worse performance for higher resolutions can be explained with the change in processing time of the images. Although there are more line segments, which means more precise information about our pose, the processing time increases, and thus this adds latency and affects the whole system performance. The Duckiebot reacts slower to offsets of its pose. [](#fig:perf_image_res_time) shows the segment processing time and number of segments for different image resolutions.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_image_res_time" figure-caption="Segment processing time and median of number of segments for different image resolutions." src="perf_image_res_time.png" alt="Image Resolution segment processing time" style="width: 400px;"/></center>


Increasing the top cutoff value means, that from the input image more of the top part is cut away to reduce visual clutter from the image background. At the same time this also decrease the number of pixels being processed and thus lowers the mean latency as well.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_image_res_top_d" figure-caption="Performance of 'a313' for different top cutoffs in pixels." src="perf_image_res_top_d.png" alt="Top cutoff performance test" style="width: 400px;"/></center>





We run a benchmark to evaluate the influence of the top cutoff on the performance. The test was performed with an image resolution of 120x160 pixels. The results are shown in [](#fig:perf_image_res_top_d). 40 pixels is the standard top cutoff values. This means the upper 40 pixels are cut away from each image. While increasing the top cutoff amount, the $d_{mean}$ decreases slightly while $\phi_{mean}$ increases slightly. We don’t see big changes in performance until the top cutoff gets quite big. At this point the Duckiebot does not see enough to control according to the actual pose situation.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_image_res_top_time" figure-caption="Segment process time and number of segments for different top cutoffs in pixels." src="perf_image_res_top_time.png" alt="Top cutoff performance test" style="width: 400px;"/></center>



As we can see in [](#fig:perf_image_res_top_time), the segment process time and therefore the latency decreases proportionally to the number of segments. This graph also explains the reduced performance in [](#fig:perf_image_res_top_d) since with under 25 segments it is hard to get an accurate pose estimation. In this case a higher top cutoff lowers the performance and at the same time the latency. So, we might see an increase in performance if we combine higher top cutoff with higher resolution, since there the increased latency was an issue.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_image_res_hist" figure-caption="Performance for different resolutions of $d$ in histogram in $cm$." src="perf_image_res_hist.png" alt="Histogram performance test" style="width: 400px;"/></center>



We also tested the influence of the histogram size for the generation of the votes. The results are shown in [](#fig:perf_image_res_hist). Making the vote histogram cell size smaller increases the accuracy of the pose estimation. At the same time more segments are needed to get a precise estimate and reduce the influence of noise. We see that the performance is going down for a higher histogram resolution. At the same time [](#fig:perf_image_res_hist_time) shows that the segment processing time stays more or less constant for different histogram resolutions. This actually shows, that the decrease in performance results from the missing of a distinct pose for higher resolutions.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_image_res_hist_time" figure-caption="Segment processing time and number of segments for different resolutions of $d$ in histogram in $cm$." src="perf_image_res_hist_time.png" alt="Histogram performance test" style="width: 400px;"/></center>

<col6 align='center' style="text-align:left" id='image_res_top' figure-id="tab:image_res_top" figure-caption="Combining image resolution and top cutoff.">
   <span>Resolution</span>      <span>Top Cutoff</span>     <span>$t_{latency} [s]$</span>       <span>$d_{mean} [cm]$</span>    <span>$\phi_{mean} [rad]$</span>    <span>$n_{segments} [-]$</span>

</col6>

As we can see from [](#tab:image_res_top), the configuration with resolution 150x200 and top cutoff 75 can improve the lane control performance compared to the standard configuration with resolution 120x160 and top cutoff 40 without changing the lane controller itself or the pose estimator. Note that all the results from this section have been tested with the improved lane controller.

#### Segment interpolation benchmark

Another approach to improve the pose estimator is to increase the amount of line segments without increasing the image resolution. Here we take each line segment and divide it into smaller pieces of which each has a vote on the belief image. Good line segments cast more votes to the same pose estimate, while bad segments (e.g. which are further away or outliers) have less weight on casting wrong results. Think of it as a filter to improve quality of the lane pose estimate.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_segment_d" figure-caption="Performance for different segment interpolations." src="perf_segment_d.png" alt="Performance evaluation of segment interpolation" style="width: 400px;"/></center>



As we can see in [](#fig:perf_segment_d), we tested up to interpolating a line segment 5 times. There aren’t any significant changes to the lane following performance except for one outlier while interpolating with 3 line segments. If we look closer, we can see that the actual performance gets worse the more we interpolate due to processing speed of the raspberry pi.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_segment_t" figure-caption="Standard deviation of $d$ and mean latency for different segment interpolations." src="perf_segment_t.png" alt="Performance evaluation of segment interpolation" style="width: 400px;"/></center>




[](#fig:perf_segment_t) shows the standard deviation of $d$ ($d_{stdev}$) and how it increases the more we interpolate due to higher latency. This behavior is observable on straight lanes where the Duckiebot oscillates around the reference trajectory. We can see this in [](#fig:perf_segment_osc) for a run with 5 interpolated segments per detected segments. From 50 to 70 sec we can observe the oscillations on a straight lane due to high latencies.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_segment_osc" figure-caption="Benchmark graph for a run with 'a313' and 5 interpolated segments per detected segment." src="perf_segment_osc.png" alt="Performance evaluation of segment interpolation" style="width: 400px;"/></center>



#### Curvature estimation benchmark

In this section,  we want to evaluate the curvature estimation performance. What the curvature estimator basically does is dividing the input image into several circular sections with equi-radial distance to the Duckiebot. From each section it derives the pose and evaluates, how it changes in these sections. This will tell us, how the road in front of the Duckiebot looks like. Then again, this feature has an impact on the lane following performance of the Duckiebot since the processing power of the raspberry pi is limited and any added latency will slow the bot down.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_curvature_estim" figure-caption="Performance for different numbers of belief images from 1 to 7 where the first image is for the actual pose estimation and the further ones are for the curvature estimation (curvature resolution)." src="perf_curvature_estim.png" alt="Performance evaluation of curvature estimation" style="width: 400px;"/></center>



In [](#fig:perf_curvature_estim) on the horizontal we can see the number of belief images being evaluated (curvature estimation resolution). The higher the number, the better we can forecast the type of the road (left curve, right curve, straight lane). With a number of 1, there is no curvature estimation (basically the old pose estimator). We can see that the performance compared to the old pose estimator is much better. This is because the reference run with 1 belief image has been recorded before and the calibration may have changed. Anyway, we can see a decrease in lane following performance, the higher the amount of belief images or image sections are created. This is due to higher cpu cost and increased latency. From tests we can see that a number of 4 belief images is sufficient to tell in most cases, at what kind of road type we are looking at.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_curvature_estim_dstd" figure-caption="Standard deviation of $d$ and $\phi$ for different numbers of belief images." src="perf_curvature_estim_dstd.png" alt="Performance evaluation of curvature estimation" style="width: 400px;"/></center>



A look at [](#fig:perf_curvature_estim_dstd) showing the standard deviation tells us, that performance decreases with higher numbers of belief images (curvature estimation resolution).

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_curvature_estim_t" figure-caption="Segment processing time and number of segments for different numbers of belief images." src="perf_curvature_estim_t.png" alt="Performance evaluation of curvature estimation" style="width: 400px;"/></center>



Same as in other sections, the main performance is heavily depending on the overall latency of the code being executed on the Duckiebot. The latency of segment processing is shown in [](#fig:perf_curvature_estim_t)

We improved the code on curvature estimation and retook all tests to better compare how the Duckiebot behaves. In the following we will see similar graphs with 1 belief image on the old pose estimator, 4 and 7 belief images on the new curvature estimator and again 1, 4 and 7 belief images on the improved estimator.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_curvature_estim_improved" figure-caption="Performance of 1, 4 and 7 belief images for old curvature estimation on the left 1, 4 and 7 belief images for improved curvature estimation on the right." src="perf_curvature_estim_improved.png" alt="Performance evaluation of improved curvature estimation" style="width: 400px;"/></center>




It is observable in [](#fig:perf_curvature_estim_improved) that the improved curvature estimation performs slightly better in all three cases. In [](#fig:perf_curvature_estim_t_improved) we see that the latency for the improved curvature estimator is lower and therefore the case with just one belief image (meaning the curvature estimation is turned off) performs especially well.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_curvature_estim_t_improved" figure-caption="Segment processing time and number of segments of 1, 4 and 7 belief images for old curvature estimation on the left 1, 4 and 7 belief images for improved curvature estimation on the right." src="perf_curvature_estim_t_improved.png" alt="Performance evaluation of improved curvature estimation" style="width: 400px;"/></center>




### Performance Evaluation of Controller

#### Stopping in front of red stop line

We evaluated if the Duckiebot is able to stop in front of the red stop line within the defined specifications. In order to test the stopping behavior, we tested the old controller and the new controller and measured the pose in front of the stop line. The results in [](#tab:redline_results) show that we are able to improve the stopping in front of the red line. The performance shows to be in the bound of the target values. The target stopping distance to the center of the red line should be 16 to 10 cm and the final heading angle should be in the range of $\phi=-10^{\circ}$ to $\phi=10^{\circ}$.

<col4 align='center' style="text-align:left" id='redline_results' figure-id="tab:redline_results" figure-caption="Stopping at Stop Line Evaluation.">
   <span> </span>      <span>$d_{mean}$</span>     <span>$$\phi_{mean}$$</span>       <span>Mean stopping distance to center of red line</span>

   <span>New Controller</span> <span>$-0.6cm$</span>     <span>$3.6^{\circ}$</span>    <span>$8.2cm$</span>
</col4>

#### Controller benchmark

The performance of the controller has been benchmarked under varying configurations, i.e. with the old baseline controller, the improved controller with the implemented Integrator and finally the same improved controller with addition of a correction for the static offset. The results of this benchmarking are shown in [](#tab:controller_results). Notably the controller did not use the improved estimator for this benchmark, rather the baseline estimator was used. The desired state throughout the benchmark is $d = 0.0$ and $\phi = 0.0$.

<col5 align='center' style="text-align:left" id='controller_results' figure-id="tab:controller_results" figure-caption="Results for controller evaluation of old controller, new integral part and offset correction.">
  <span> </span>    <span>$d_{mean} [cm]$</span>    <span>$d_{std} [cm]$</span>    <span>$\phi_{mean} [rad]$</span>    <span>$\phi_{std} [rad]$</span>
  <span>Old Controller</span>    <span>3.16</span>     <span>0.45</span>   <span>-0.40</span>    <span>0.1</span>
  <span>New Integral Part</span>    <span>-2.08</span>    <span>0.08</span>    <span>-0.11</span>   <span>0.07</span>
  <span>Offset Correction</span>    <span>-0.45</span>     <span>0.16</span>    <span>-0.03</span>     <span>0.20</span>
</col5>

As observable in [](#tab:controller_results), the lane following performance increased drastically after improving the controller. First, by implementing the Integrator into the controller, the performance improved in terms of a lower static offset as well as a lower mean heading angle. Additionally, the standard deviation of both **d** and **$\phi$** was lowered considerably. This means that the Duckiebot stayed much closer to the desired position in the center of the lane, even after a long time. Therefore, the performance improved greatly with help of the Integrator alone already.

Further, by correcting the remaining static offset, the static offset was cancelled out completely and the median heading angle was lowered as well. This is a very important result, as the static offset represented a vital problem.

In addition to the quantitative benchmarking above, the performance was evaluated qualitatively as well by observing the driving Duckiebot. From those observations, the performance improvements in terms of a cancelled static offset as well as a much lower median heading angle were very clearly noticed as well. By directly comparing the performance of the old and new controller qualitatively, the improvement of the controller is very clearly visible. With the new controller the Duckiebot never touches the middle and outer lines, drives very robust, there is no static offset and no overshoot after the curves is observed.

#### Non-conforming curve benchmark

<div figure-id="fig:big_curve_video">
    <figcaption>Non conforming big curve.</figcaption>
    <dtvideo src="vimeo:257020623"/>
</div>

We benchmarked the controller not only for the straight lanes and curves which are conforming with the Duckietown specification, rather the new improved controller was also tested on lanes with non-conforming geometries such as a very large and wide curve as shown in [](#fig:big_curve_video) and a very narrow and harsh S-curve as shown in [](#fig:controller_video). This benchmark was conducted in order to test the robustness of the controller to varying lane geometries. This is a very relevant test, as the geometry of the duckietown can not always be guaranteed. In addition, a controller which works good for a wide range of geometries would be desired.
The results of those tests with non conforming curve geometries can be found in [](#fig:non_conforming).

<object width= "500" height="500" type="application/pdf"  figure-id="fig:non_conforming" figure-caption="Results from benchmark on non-conforming curves." data="nonconforming_curve.pdf"></object>




As can be seen from the results in [](#fig:non_conforming) for both tested non conforming curves the performance improved considerably by introducing the new controller. Both the mean distance to the center of the lane **d** and the mean heading angle **$\phi$** have been improved. In addition, the standard deviation of both of those metrics were reduced as well. Those results show that the performance of the new controller was improved with respect to non conforming curve geometries. Since only two non conforming geometries have been tested, this test represents far from all non conforming geometries. In future benchmarks with respect to geometry robustness, this fact should be considered and more non conforming geometries should be tested.
Nevertheless, the performance on those two tested non conforming curves are very promising and point to a strong robustness with respect to altering geometries.

#### Performance of the controller on curvy road

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_controller_curvy_old" figure-caption="Benchmark of Duckiebot on curvy roads with the baseline controller from last year." src="perf_controller_curvy_old.png" alt="Performance old controller on curvy roads" style="width: 400px;"/></center>


Benchmark of Duckiebot with baseline controller from last year’s implementation. Most notably, the median lateral position of the Duckiebot $d_{est\_median}$ is higher compared to the new implementation of the controller.

<center><img figure-id="fig:perf_controller_curvy_new" figure-caption="Benchmark of Duckiebot on curvy roads with the new improved controller." src="perf_controller_curvy_new.png" alt="Performance new controller on curvy roads" style="width: 400px;"/></center>


Benchmark of Duckiebot with new controller implementation. Most notably, the median lateral position of the Duckiebot $d_{est\_median}$ is lower compared to the old implementation of the controller.

#### Performance of the controller on non conforming lanes

We also made some test to show that our controller is able to cope with situations that are not conforming with the Duckietown specifications. [](#fig:thicker_lines_video) shows a run with thicker white and yellow lines then specified and [](#fig:missing_lines_video) shows a run with some white and yellow lines missing. In both videos the new controller is still able to follow the lane as expected.

### Failed Implementations

**Estimator**    
Although the 7 ranges estimation provided low mean deviation from the actual position and provided good prediction of the upcoming curve as well as its curvature direction.  The 7 ranges estimation failed in the implementation of the lane following demo due to high computation requirement and the caused time latency.


**Controller**    
Feedforward during lane following:
As the feedforward part during lane following depends entirely on the estimation of the curve, this part failed due to bad estimation of the curves in certain situations as well as the increased latency due to the curvature estimation. Whenever a curve is not correctly detected or not precisely at the beginning of the curve, the feedforward part introduces additional instability. This is especially a problem in the notorious S curves. Therefore, the implementation of the feedforward works good if a precises estimation of the curve is available that works without introducing high latencies. Although, such a precise curvature estimation with low latency is not available at the moment. Hence, the feedforward part during lane following is not robust enough for the current curvature estimation. Nevertheless, the feedforward part is useful for other nodes to interact with the controller. In certain situations other nodes are able to use the feedforward part in order to follow paths (navigators on intersections and parking team on parking lots).

### Challenges

* Limited computational power of Raspberry Pi.
    - Estimation of curvature introduced high latencies.
    - By increasing the resolution of the picture we would get more segments and this would make both a better pose and curvature estimation possible. Nevertheless, the latency is also increased significantly.
* Duckiebot with different wheels (slippery and non-slippery wheels)
* Some Duckiebots prove to have higher latency when running the same code. This increased latency is a problem.
* Lightning has a very big influence on the performance
    - Depending on the light condition of duckietown the number of detected segments as well as the correctness of the color is varying. Especially reflection on yellow tape makes it appear white. To tackle this issue, a polarisation filter was found to have a positive influence. This might need to be considered in future hardware updates.
    - Anti instagram might not be as good for every light condition.

#### Effect of anti-instagram on segment detection in curves

In case Anti-Instagram is badly calibrated, the Duckiebot will not see enough line segments. This is especially a problem in the curve and the Duckiebot could leave the lane. An example of this failure can be seen in [](#fig:anti_instagram_video) for which we had a bad Anti-Instagram calibration. Hence, the Duckiebot sees not enough line segments and the lane following fails in the curve. To solve the problem Anti-Instagram needs to be relaunched. In the last part of the video above the __X__ button on the joystick is pressed and the Anti-Instagram node gets relaunched. We can see in the last part of the video RVIZ that the number of detected line segments gets increased dramatically after the recalibration.

</div>

### Conclusion

Even though a slightly higher image resolution with higher top cutoff can improve the lane following performance slightly we sticked with the original resolution of 120x160 pixels with 40 pixels top cutoff because also other teams depend on the image resolution. We saw that our curvature estimation was able to detect the standard curves of Duckietown in many cases, at the same time it introduced a high latency which again lowered the performance. Therefore we decided to set the curvature resolution to 0 by default, which means that no curvature estimation is done. The code nevertheless is still in the lane filter to give a basis for further improvements.

Regarding the controller the test showed that the added integral part in the PID controller and the tuning of the control parameters gave a huge improvement of the lane following performance. The integrated feedforward part can not be used during the lane following, because it is depending on the curvature estimation. The feedforward part can be used by other teams (e.g. on intersections and parking lots) to integrate our controller.

The improved controller gives a clear improvement over the baseline controller as can be seen in [](#fig:demo_video) and [](#fig:controller_video)



## Future avenues of development {#controllers-final-next-steps}

As there is always more to do and the performance for both the controller and the estimator can still be further enhanced we list in this section some suggestions for next steps to take.

### Estimator

To make curvature estimation applicable it has to be made more robust and at the same time more computationally efficient adding less delay to the system. In its current state the added delay is too high and the performance with curvature estimation switched on decreases.

### Controller

* Integrate the inputs of other teams, [see](#controllers-int-report).
* After doing the new kinematic calibration provided by the System Identification group:
    - The controller parameters should be adjusted according to the output of the calibration.
    - The correction factors **velocity_to_m_per_s** and **omega_to_rad_per_s** need to be adjusted or ideally become obsolete and thus need to be deleted.
* To reduce impact of time delays, e.g. a Smith Predictor could be implemented.
* For the activation of the remaining interfaces (e.g. intersection navigation and parking), the respective commented out sections of the final code needs to be activated and the integration needs to be completed in collaboration with the other teams.

### General

* Anti-Instagram should be enhanced, in order to identify more line segments and perceive the correct color.
* Adding a polarization filter to reduce impact of reflections on color perception.
* New edge detection with higher accuracy.
* Replacing the Raspberry Pi with something more computationally powerful to ensure low latency and enable a more complex pose estimation.
